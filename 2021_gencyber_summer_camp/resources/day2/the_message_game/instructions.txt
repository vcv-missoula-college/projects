Once your group is split into two, you will recieve a password
Retrieve your original messages by running:
  ./1_getOriginal.sh ip_address groupWithSide

You can now encrypt your messages. They are found in 1_original/
Once you encrypt the files, put them in 2_submission/

Submit your files by running
  ./2_submitEncrypted.sh ip_address groupWithSide

This will send all the files in your submission directory




After everyone has submitted, you can run
  ./3_getEncrypted ip_address groupWithSide

This will retrieve all the files that were submitted from everyone (with randomized file names).
These files will be placed in 3_shared/
Work to decrypt the files, placing any decrypted files in 4_decrypted/
You will lose points for submitting any files in error (including your original files)


When you are done decrypting everything, run
  ./4_submitDecrypted.sh ip_address groupWithSide

We will then figure out everyone's score.
