Once your group is split into two, you will recieve a password
Retrieve your original messages by running:
  ./1_getOriginal.sh ip_address groupWithSide

You can now encrypt your messages.



Submit your files by running
  ./2_submitEncrypted.sh ip_address groupWithSide

This will send all the files in your submission directory



When everything is submitted, you can run
  ./3_getEncrypted ip_address groupWithSide

This will retrieve all the files that were submitted from everyone (with randomized file names).
Work to decrypt the files, placing any decrypted files in 'decrypted'


When you are done decrypting everything, run
  ./4_submitDecrypted.sh ip_address groupWithSide

We will then figure out everyone's score.
